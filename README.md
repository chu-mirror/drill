It's not rare to see a programmer reading tons of documents for a small problem,
such as tuning the appearance of output. He or she definitely knows how to do
that but always lacks the knowledge of how to implement it.  This project is meant
to reduce the effort in searching by periodically providing drills for practicing.

And let's take a broader view: any language humans use consists of miscellaneous details.
If we want to use a language in practice, we must consistently practice it
to absorb as many details as we can. The spirit here is the same with programming,
so I might add a lot of drills unrelated to programming to the set.
