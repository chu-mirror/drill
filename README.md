It's not rare to see a programmer reading tons of documents only for a small
problem like tuning the appearence of output.  He or she definitely know how to
do that, but always lack the knowledge of how to implement it.  This project
is meant to reduce the effort in searching, by periodically providing drills
for practicing.

And let's take a broader view, any language human using consists of the
miscellaneous details.  If we want to use a language in practice, we must consistently
practice it to absorb details as many as we can.  The spirit here is same with
programming, so I might add a lot of drills unrelated to programming to the set.
